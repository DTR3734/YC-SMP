# PEPPOL SMP Server

A full-stack PEPPOL SMP server application built with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. This server provides all the necessary functionality to manage and publish PEPPOL participant capabilities in a compliant manner.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **PEPPOL-compliant Endpoints:** Implements the required Service Group and Service Metadata endpoints.
*   **Full-stack Application:** Includes a front-end for administrative tasks.
*   **User Management:** Secure user authentication and management with password hashing.
*   **Participant Management:** CRUD operations for managing SMP participants.
*   **Multiple Modes:** Supports `development`, `certification`, `uae-certification`, and irreversible `production` modes.
*   **Database Support:** Uses PostgreSQL for robust data storage in production.
*   **Secure:** Uses HTTPS with self-signed certificates for development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local instance of the SMP server up and running, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with Node.js)
-   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (v14 or later)
-   `openssl` (for generating a self-signed certificate)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DTR3734/YC-SMP.git
    cd YC-SMP
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure your environment:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your database connection details:

    ```env
    # .env
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=your_postgres_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
    DB_DATABASE=smp_server
    DB_PORT=5432
    ```

4.  **Initialize the database:**

    ```bash
    npm run db:init
    ```

5.  **Generate self-signed certificates for HTTPS:**

    ```bash
    npm run generate-certs
    ```

6.  **Run the server in development mode:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The server will be available at `https://localhost:3001`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Application Modes

The application can run in several modes:

*   **`development`**: Default mode for local development.
*   **`certification`**: For testing compliance with PEPPOL standards.
*   **`uae-certification`**: For testing compliance with the specific requirements of the UAE PEPPOL Authority.
*   **`production`**: For live, operational use. **This mode is irreversible.**

You can switch modes via the API endpoint `PUT /api/mode` with a JSON body like `{"mode": "certification"}`.
